Application/Resume  
My Name is Louie, I am an energetic, outgoing and passionate guy looking for new challenges, 
assignments and acquaintances. Since I was around 14, I have been working with customer service. 
This has resulted in a lot of experience when it comes to general handling of customers, logistics and 
soft skills.  
I currently work as a Senior Technical Advisor (2nd line support) at Webhelp. Here, my responsibility is to 
give the best award-winning support to our client’s customers. I also handle the upset customers as a 
Senior Advisor or take responsibility when something goes wrong. It would be my job to fix it. In this job, I 
also handle repairs and communicate with our client’s worldwide network of authorized service providers. 
All my life I have had a big passion for IT. I take pride in building my own computers and fixing them 
when necessary. Some of my spare time, I like to spend playing video games.  
With my time at Webhelp, I have developed expertise in both software and hardware. Specifically, at 
Webhelp, my department specializes in iOS and macOS devices.
